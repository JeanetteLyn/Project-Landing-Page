# Project-Landing-Page
Project: Creating a landing page from a given design

The landing page is an exercise in developing frontend web skills from a given design. The landing page itself is a simple. single page design, containing a few sections such as the header, hero section, a horizontal list display, testimonial, call to action, and finally a footer.

The styling is simple, using a palette of 4-5 colours, along with 1-2 fonts.

The only significant complexity in the design includes links in the header, along with the c-t-a buttons across the landing page.
